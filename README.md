# Kaggle-Loan-Approval

# Introduction
This project uses the following loan approval dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/architsharma01/loan-approval-prediction-dataset
In this project we develop a machine learning classifcation model to predict the approval status of a loan with 98% accuracy and f1-score=0.98. 

# Exploratory Data Analysis
We initially check the data for missing values, which this dataset has none, get a list of the features and get the summary statistics for the data.

Dependent Variable : Loan Status

Features:
* Number of Dependents
* education (Graduate or Non-Graduate)
* Employment Status
* Annual Income
* Loan Amount
* Loan Term
* Credit Score
* Residential Asset Value
* Commercial Asset Value

From this we then procedd to carry out some Exploratory Data Analysis using seaborn to visualise the data and understand the relations between the variables.
We generate bar graphs, histograms and a correlation heatmap.
Some of which can be seen below:
